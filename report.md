# Report

### Learning Algorithm
The report clearly describes the learning algorithm,
along with the chosen hyperparameters. It also describes the model architectures for any neural networks.


### Training Results
Plot of rewards
A plot of rewards per episode is included to illustrate that either
the agent is able to receive an average reward (over 100 episodes, and over all 20 agents) of at least +30.

The submission reports the number of episodes needed to solve the environment.


### Ideas for Future Work
The submission has concrete future ideas for improving the agent's performance.
